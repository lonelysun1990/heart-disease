Kaggle competition: predicting a (fictitious) heart disease

This data set is derived from the South African Heart data set in Elements of Statistical Learning

Our goal is to predict the binary Status (a simulated response) from the other features, with particular interest in seeing if our new assay is predictive of disease or not.

Our features (which have all been standardized) are:

old_assay: a previous biological measurement used to predict this disease;

gold_standard: standard-of-care predictive score for this disease;

assay: a new assay developed in lab you are working with.

BP: a measure of blood pressure;

smoking: a measure of cumulative tobacco use;

alcohol: a measure of alcohol consumption;

cholesterol: a measure of cholesterol;

behavior: a behavioral measure measuring risk for this disease;

BMI: standardized body mass index;

age: subject age
